Website makes use of twitter bootstrap and lightVC as the frontend and backend frameworks. 

There is no installer for this website, if you wish to run it locally you must setup your webhost config file to point to /HW5/webroot/ and AllowOverride for the .htaccess file 

For LightVC documentation see the local copy in modules/lightvc/README.md or the version for the current release at [the website](http://lightvc.org/).
